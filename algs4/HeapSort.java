/**
 * Sort a sequence of strings using heap sort.
 *
 * The HeapSort class provides a static method to sort an array
 * using heapsort.
 *
 * This implementation takes Q(nlogn) time to sort any array of length n
 * (assuming comparisons take constant time). It makes at most
 * 2nlog2n compares.
 *
 * The sorting algorithm is not stable.
 * It uses Q(1) extra memory (not including the input array).
