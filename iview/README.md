## Trees

- ### Trees - Notes & Background
    - [ ] Series: Trees
        - Basic tree construction
        - Traversal
        - Manipulation algorithms
    - [ ] BFS(Breadth-First-Search) and DFS(Depth-First Search)
        - BFS notes:
            - Level order (BFS, using queue)
            - Time complexity: O(n)
            - Space complexity: best O(1), worst O(n/2) = O(n)
        - DFS notes:
            - Time complexity: O(n)
            - Space complexity: best O(log n), worst O(n)
            - inorder (DFS: left, self, right)
            - postorder (DFS: left, right, self)
            - preorder (DFS: self, left, right)
  
## Sorting

- [ ] Notes:
    - Implement sorts & know best case/worst case, average complexity of each:
        - No bubble sort - it's terrible - O(n^2), except when n <= 16.
